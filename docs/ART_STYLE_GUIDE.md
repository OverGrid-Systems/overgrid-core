# ART_STYLE_GUIDE (LOCKED) — OverGrid / Total Command

Single source of truth for visual identity. Any change requires PR + CI green + updated IDENTITY_LOCKSUMS_V0.

## 0) Product Goal
A modern RTS with the readability and "military hardware vibe" of Generals: Zero Hour, but grounded, contemporary, and consistent.

## 1) Camera & Readability
- RTS high-angle / isometric-ish.
- The game must read at 64px icon size and at maximum zoom-out.
- Silhouette beats micro-detail. If it reads in silhouette, it is allowed.
- Units must remain identifiable on desert, urban, snow, and night maps.

## 2) Lighting & Color Rules
- Neutral daylight baseline. Avoid dramatic colored lights.
- Faction colors are accents only (stripes, panels, small decals). No full-body faction tint.
- Materials drive the look: painted metal, rubber, composite, glass, dust.

## 3) Material Language
- Military realism: bolts, vents, armor seams are allowed but must not clutter.
- Weathering: subtle dust, edge wear, exhaust soot. No “post-apocalyptic” rust.
- Surfaces are functional. No fantasy shapes, spikes, ornamental edges.

## 4) Silhouette Rules (Hard)
- Each unit type must have a unique silhouette family:
  - Infantry: humanoid + gear outline (backpack/weapon).
  - Light vehicle: low profile, wheels/track visible, turret/weapon distinct.
  - Heavy vehicle: wider stance, larger turret/hull break-up.
  - Air: wings/rotors shape must be readable from above.
- No two units share the same top-down outline within a faction.

## 5) Scale & Proportions
- Real-ish proportions, not toy-like.
- Weapons must not be oversized. Keep plausibility.

## 6) UI / Icon Style
- Icons: simple, high-contrast, top-down or 3/4 depending on category.
- Icons must not rely on color alone; shape must carry meaning.
- Avoid thin lines. Avoid tiny text inside icons.

## 7) Prohibited
- Fantasy elements (glowing runes, magic, sci-fi crystals).
- Excessive neon.
- Hyper-real cinematic DOF/film grain baked into assets.
