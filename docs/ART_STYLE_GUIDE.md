# ART_STYLE_GUIDE (LOCKED) — OverGrid / Total Command

This file is the single source of truth for visual identity. Any change requires PR + CI green.

## Camera & Render Assumptions (RTS)
- High-angle RTS camera (isometric-ish).
- Neutral daylight lighting. No dramatic colored lighting.
- Readability at distance first: silhouette > values > detail.

## Silhouette Rules
- Every unit must be identifiable at RTS zoomed-out distance and at 64px icon size.
- No two units share the same silhouette class.

## Materials & Color
- Realistic military materials: painted metal, rubber, composites, glass.
- Faction color is used as accents only (not full-body recolor).

## Icons
- Flat readable shapes, minimal noise.
- High contrast at small sizes.
